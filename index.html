            <p>
                First year undergraduate in Computer Science at Canterbury Christ Church University after
                completing first year of psychology from 2022 - 2023. My skillset includes problem solving, time
                management, decision making, communication and organisational skills, teamworking and
                leadership when necessary. I have a clear, logical mind with a practical approach to problem
                solving and a drive to see things through to completion. I enjoy working on my own initiative or as
                part of a team. I seek a challenge and am flexible, adaptable and willing to learn. My commitment,
                enthusiasm and determination to succeed enhance my contribution and effectiveness in the
                workplace.
